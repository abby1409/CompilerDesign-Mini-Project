CompilerDesign-Mini-Project
===========================
This project aims to develop an efficient tool which takes a set of fuzzy statements, processes them intelligently and
then generates an output in the form of a complete natural language statement.

The fuzzy statement will specify the membership value of a subject in a particular set. This membership value defines as 
to what degree is the particular quality (set) is possessed by that subject. 

A subject may be associated with more than one set. 

We will process the membership values of all the sets and generate a complete statement in natural language.

All you need to run this is explained in the project report. Ping me for any further help. Cheers.
